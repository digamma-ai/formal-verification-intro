\begin{abstract}

In this presentation we will talk about formal verification of programs written in C using Coq proof assistant. We will introduce Coq's basic functionality, explain how Coq works internally and on a toy example show how to use it to verify functional and imperative programs, and how the two approaches differ. We will also show a motivational example of verifying a function from existing C code.

\section{What are formal methods?}
\begin{frame}{Formal verification}
 
  We want to have high assurance that the code we wrote works as intended and is bug-free. One of the methods to do this is {\bf formal verification}, which amounts to producing {\it a formal proof} of correctness.

  {\center What does it mean and how do we do it?}
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item We write the \emph{specification} in {\it a formal language} which unambiguously defines how our program should behave.
  \item Then we model our program and its actual behaviour, that is, we define the \emph{semantics} of our program. 
  \item Finally we mathematically prove that the behaviour of our program matches the specification.
\end{enumerate}

In what follows we will talk about formal verfication using {\bf Coq proof assistant}.
  
\end{frame}

\section{Verifying C code: a motivating example}

\begin{frame}{\texttt{asn\_strtoimax\_lim} of ASN.1C compiler}
  At \url{Digamma.ai} we are working on formal verification of existing {\bf imperative} programs using Coq. We took a function \texttt{asn\_strtoimax\_lim} from \texttt{asn1c} compiler to test our approach on a simple real-life example.
  

  Informal specification from the comments: 

 \begin{quote}
 Parse the number in the given string until the given *end position,
 returning the position after the last parsed character back using the
 same (*end) pointer.
 WARNING: This behavior is different from the standard strtol/strtoimax(3).
\end{quote}
\end{frame}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{A bug uncovered during verification}

   During correctness proof, some proof obligations about the for loop were produced that could not be met, because of a bug in the function. Can you see it?

  \url{https://github.com/vlm/asn1c/issues/344}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Negative range bug example}

When we go beyond allowed \textit{int} range, a wrong result is given for some inputs:  

\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
input & \texttt{-9223372036854775809} \\
intmax & \texttt{\ 9223372036854775807}\\
upper boundary& \texttt{\ 922337203685477580} \\
last digit max& \texttt{\ 7}\\
return & \color{green}\texttt{\ ASN\_STRTOX\_ERROR\_RANGE}\\
\hline \\
input & \texttt{-9223372036854775810} \\
intmax & \texttt{\ 9223372036854775807}\\
upper boundary& \texttt{\ 922337203685477580} \\
last digit max& \texttt{\ 7}\\
return & \color{red}\texttt{\ 70, ASN\_STRTOX\_OK}\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Negative range bug}
    This happens whenever the input string represents a number smaller than \texttt{MIN\_INT}, due to the fact that absolute value of \texttt{MIN\_INT} is greater than \texttt{MAX\_INT}, thus negative number cannot be treated as $\mathrm{value}\times\mathrm{sign}$ when $\mathrm{value}$ is represented as \textit{int}. 
    
    Formal proof has to cover all cases, hence this bug became obvious during the proof.

    Is this fix OK? Look at this part of the code:

     \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
  if(str < *end) {
    *end = str;
    if(*str >= 0x30 && *str <= 0x39){
      return ASN_STRTOX_ERROR_RANGE;
    } else {
      *intp = sign * value;
      return ASN_STRTOX_EXTRA_DATA;
    }

\begin{frame}{Memory store bug explained (1/3)}

    Let minimal signed int \texttt{MIN\_INT} = $-4775808$ 

    \texttt{*str} = {\color{red}2d 34 37 37 35 38 30 31 31 31} ( stands for ``-477580111'') 

   {\bf Scenario 1}:

    Assume that \texttt{*end = str + 9} and \texttt{end} $\geq$ $\texttt{str + 9}$.

     {\color{red}2d 34 37 37 35 38 30 {\color{blue}$\overbrace{31}^{\texttt{str + 7}}$} 31 31 $\ldots$ $\overbrace{\texttt{X}}^{\texttt{end}}$}

     Then at \texttt{str + 7} we store \texttt{*end = (str + 7)}

     Let \texttt{str + 7 = 21 21 21 26} 

     {\color{red}2d 34 37 37 35 38 30 31 {\color{blue} $\overbrace{31}^{\texttt{str + 8}}$} 31  $\ldots$ $\overbrace{\texttt{21 21 21 26}}^{\texttt{end}}$}
     
     And since at \texttt{str + 8} we read `1'
     

     
     The output is  \color{green}\texttt{ASN\_ERROR\_RANGE}.


  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Memory store bug explained (2/3)}

    Let minimal signed int \texttt{MIN\_INT} = $-4775808$ 

    \texttt{*str} = {\color{red}2d 34 37 37 35 38 30 31 31 31} (stands for ``-477580111'') 

    {\bf Scenario 2}:

    Assume that \texttt{*end = str + 9} and \texttt{end = str + 7}:
    
    {\color{red}2d 34 37 37 35 38 {\color{blue} $\overbrace{30 \; 31 \; 31 \; 31}^{\texttt{end}}$}}
    

    Then at \texttt{str + 7} we store \texttt{*end = str + 7}

     Let \texttt{str + 7 = 21 21 21 26} 

   
    {\color{red}2d 34 37 37 35 38 30 {\color{blue}$\overbrace{21 \; 21 \; 21 \; 26}^{\texttt{end}}$}}
    (stands for $``-477580!!!\&''$)

    And since at \texttt{str + 8} we read `!' 

    The output is \color{red}\texttt{ASN\_EXTRA\_DATA}.
    
    \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Memory store: A bug or an implicit restriction?}

We have demonstrated that when the value of the \texttt{end} pointer is treated as a part of the input data, there is a bug where the resulting error value could be incorrect.

On the other hand, it is hard to think of a legitimate use-case where the pointer would be a part the input data. Under such interpretation, there is an implicit pre-condition in the specification, mandating that:

{\small
\texttt{(*end < end) || (end + sizeof(const char *) <= str)}}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Specification question}
After addressing the two buges we discovered we were able to successfully verify that the function finally corresponds to the specification we wrote for. However, it was noticed the following behavior:

For input \texttt{"a"} it returns {\color{green}\texttt{0,ASN\_STRTOX\_EXTRA\_DATA}}.

Is it a bug or a feature?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Lessons learned}

This code was part of the library for 15 years. The library is covered by extensive unit and randomized tests. It is used in production by multiple users. Yet, the vulnerabilities are there and pose potential problems.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first bug is related to data type ranges and modulo integer arithmetic. These sort of problems are fairly common and require careful coding to be avoided. Formal verification enforces a strict mathematical model of all computer arithmetic and invariably exposes all such bugs.
    \item The second problem was related to \textit{pointer aliasing}. These problems are not immediately obvious because C language does not allow us to enforce any memory aliasing restrictions (unlike, say Rust). In formal verification, there is a rigorous model to analyze such kind of problems called \textit{separation logic}.
    \item The third issue shows us that your formal verification is only as good as your specification.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\section{Coq mini-intro}

\begin{frame}{Coq mini-intro}
  We did our proofs in a formal language called {\it Gallina}, a mechanized version of {\bf Calculus of Inductive Constructions}, which is a very expressive type theory well studied in mathematical logic. We write the specifications, model our programs and do the proofs in this language.

  \smallskip
We could do all of the above on paper, but it would quickly get out of hand. Moreover, we want to be sure that there are no mistakes in the proofs. So we use a tool called {\bf proof assistant}: a program that checks that your proof is correct. It also provides an environment to make the construction of proofs easier. 

In particular, we will talk about the Coq proof assistant: \includegraphics[width=1cm]{coq.png} \url{https://coq.inria.fr/}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What Coq does?}
  In Coq you can:
  \begin{itemize}
  
    \item define functions and predicates
    \item state mathematical theorems and software specifications
    \item interactively develop formal proofs of theorems
    \item machine-check these proofs by a relatively small trusted kernel
    \item extract certified programs to languages like OCaml, Haskell or Scheme.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Inductive definitions}

  In Coq everything is either a {\it term} or a {\it type}. You can define basic inductive types using the \texttt{Inductive} command.

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
  Inductive bool : Set :=
    | true : bool
    | false : bool.

  \end{lstlisting}

  The boolean type has two {\bf constructors}: \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}.  
  
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
  Inductive nat : Set :=
    | O : nat
    | S : nat -> nat.  
   \end{lstlisting}

   Natural numbers are defined by two constructors as well: \texttt{O} (zero) and \texttt{S} (successor function). Any {\it term} of type $\mathbb{N}$ is constructed using these two. E.g., \texttt{S O} : $\mathbb{N}$, \texttt{S (S O)} : $\mathbb{N}$, \texttt{S (S (S O))} : $\mathbb{N}$  \ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Recursive definitions}

  You can define recursive functions using the \texttt{Fixpoint} command.

  Since we know that by construction any term of type $\mathbb{N}$ is either \texttt{O} or \texttt{S n} for some $n : \mathbb{N}$, we can use {\it pattern-matching}.
  
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
  Fixpoint plus (n m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => m
  | S p => S (plus p m)
  end
   \end{lstlisting}
   
Note: Coq only accepts definitions that terminate\footnote{This limitation is needed to ensure consistency of the system, as well as decidability of type-checking.}. Here we are recursing on a direct subterm of $n$ thus we are guaranteed to terminate and Coq is able to automatically ensure this. Sometimes you have to do a termination proof by hand. 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Proofs}


  Finally, you can state and prove theorems about the objects you defined. Let $+$ be notation for \texttt{plus}.

  \begin{theorem} 2 + 3 = 5.
    \end{theorem}

  How would you prove this, if you were to justify each step of the proof?
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
Theorem plus_2_3 : (S (S O)) + (S (S (S O))) = (S (S (S (S (S O))))).
 Proof.
  unfold plus. (* apply definition of plus *)
  reflexivity. (* apply definition of equality *)
 Qed.

  \end{lstlisting}
  In Coq you constructs a proof using so-called {\sf tactics}.
  E.g., \texttt{simpl} is a tactic that performs basic application of definitions, \texttt{reflexivity} proves equality between two syntactically equal terms (modulo some reductions).  
 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{More proofs}
\begin{theorem} $\forall n,\ 0 + n = n$.
\end{theorem}

To prove this we also use the definition of addition: since the recursion is on the first term, we are in the base case.

   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
  Fixpoint plus (n m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => m (* base case *)
  | S p => S (plus p m)
  end
   \end{lstlisting}

   Proof in Coq:

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
    Theorem plus_O_n : (forall n, O + n = n).
    Proof.
      intros n. (* take any n *)
      simpl. (* apply definition of plus *)
      reflexivity. (* get equal terms *)
    Qed.
  \end{lstlisting}

 
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]{More proofs}

  Most proofs would need to go by induction (Why the previous proof won't work below? See how \texttt{plus} is defined.)

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
    Theorem plus_n_O : (forall n, n + O = n).
    Proof.
      (* proof by induction on n *)
      induction n; simpl.
      (* base case *)
      - reflexivity.
      (* inductive step *)
      - rewrite IHn. (* apply induction hypothesis *)
        reflexivity.
    Qed.

  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{More Proofs}
     In Coq you have to justify every step of the proof and the \texttt{Qed} command only succeeds on correct proofs. But you don't have to do every proof from scratch, since there are extensive libraries covering lemmas about basic mathematics as well as several decision procedures that automatize proof search.
     \begin{itemize}
     \item Using SMT and SAT solvers: \url{https://smtcoq.github.io/}
     \item First-order decision procedures (CoqHammer): \url{https://github.com/lukaszcz/coqhammer}
     \item Tactics for solving arithmetic goals over ordered rings (\texttt{Micromega})
       \item And much more, cf. \url{https://coq.inria.fr/opam/www/}
       \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

   \section{How does Coq work?}
\begin{frame}{How does Coq work?}
    We can formalize programs, properties and proofs in the same language, as well as efficiently and reliably check proof correctness due to the so-called {\bf Curry-Howard isomorphism}.

    Curry-Howard isomorphism is a correspondence between programs and terms on one hand and proofs and types on the other. All logical statements in Coq are typing judgments and thus checking the correctness of proofs amounts to type checking. Let's see what it means precisely on a small example.
   \end{frame}
   
   \begin{frame}{Curry-Howard Isomorphism (CHI)}
     We said that {\it ``Curry-Howard Isomorphism is a correspondence between programs and terms on one hand and proofs and types on the other''}. To make this precise, we need to specify what kind of programs we have on one side and what kind of proofs (that is, what kind of logic) we have on the other side.

     Various {\bf lambda calculi} were designed to describe programs.% {\it untyped lambda-calculus, simply-typed lambda calculus, polymorphic lambda-calculus, G\"{o}del's system {\bf T}, system {\bf F}} etc\footnote{cf. Lectures on Curry-Howard Isomorphism \cite{Sørensen98lectureson}}.
     If you never heard of lambda calculi, think of functional programming languages such as {\bf OCaml} and {\bf Haskell}.
     
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{The simplest CHI: simply typed lambda calculus}
    Consider the simplest example of typed lambda calculus\footnote{Or a rudimentary functional programming language.}: simply typed lambda calculus {\bf ST}. Terms of {\bf ST} are:
     \begin{description}
     \item[Var] variables
     \item[Abs] $(\lambda x.M)$, if $x$ a variable and $M$ is a term 
     \item[App] $(M N)$, if $M$ and $N$ are terms
     \end{description}
     Think of $(\lambda x.M)$ as a function with argument $x$ and body $M$ and of $(M N)$ as applying function $M$ to the argument $N$\footnote{For more details see \cite{Sørensen98lectureson}.}. %This is formalized by introducing $\beta$-{\it reduction} relation on terms:
     %\[ (\lambda x.M)N \Rightarrow_\beta M[x := N]\footnote{Meaning substitute all occurences of x in M by N.} \] 
%Some examples of $\beta$-reduction: 
 %    \[ (\lambda x.x)y \Rightarrow_\beta y \]
  %   \[ ((\lambda x.(x z)) y \Rightarrow_\beta (y z) \]

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Simply typed lambda calculus}
       
     In lambda calculus one could encode basic data types such as natural numbers and lists, as well as functions on them and logical constants and operations. {\bf ST} could be extended with a fixpoint operator to allow for recursive functions.

     Examples of terms:

     $\lambda x.x$ (identity function)
     
     $\lambda x.\lambda y. x$ (true\footnote{By convention: you could define constants in a different way as well.})

     $\lambda x.\lambda y. y$ (false or zero)

     $\lambda n. \lambda y. \lambda x. y (n y x)$ (successor function)
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Simply typed lambda-calculus}
       We are interested in a {\bf typed} lambda calculus. The types of {\bf ST} are:
        \begin{description}
     \item[Var] type variables 
     \item[Arrow] $\tau \rightarrow \sigma$, if $\tau$ and $\sigma$ are types
       \end{description}
       Types are assigned to terms according to certain rules. Let $\Gamma$ be a set of simply-typed terms (also called context). 
       \begin{prooftree}
          \AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : \tau \vdash x : \tau $ ({\bf Ax})}     
                 \end{prooftree}

         \begin{prooftree}
           \AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : \sigma \vdash M : \tau$}
           \RightLabel{({\bf Abs})}
           \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash (\lambda x. M) : \sigma \rightarrow \tau$}
         \end{prooftree}

         \begin{prooftree}
           \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash M : \sigma \rightarrow \tau$}
           \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash N : \sigma$}
           \RightLabel{({\bf App})}
           \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash (M N) : \tau$}
         \end{prooftree}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Simply typed lambda-calculus}
         Here is a simple derivation that shows that the term $\lambda x. x$ (identity) has type $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma$, with $\sigma$ being any type of {\bf ST}: \begin{prooftree}
          \AxiomC{$ x : \sigma \vdash x : \sigma$ ({\bf Ax})}
          \RightLabel{({\bf Abs})}
           \UnaryInfC{$\vdash (\lambda x. x) : \sigma \rightarrow \sigma$}
         \end{prooftree}

And if you apply identity to a term of type $\sigma$, the output is also of type $\sigma$:

\begin{prooftree}
          \AxiomC{$ y : \sigma, x : \sigma \vdash x : \sigma$ ({\bf Ax})}
          \RightLabel{({\bf Abs})}
           \UnaryInfC{$y : \sigma, \vdash (\lambda x. x) : \sigma \rightarrow \sigma$}
           \AxiomC{ $y : \sigma \vdash y : \sigma$ ({\bf Ax})}
           \RightLabel{({\bf App})}
           \BinaryInfC{ $y : \sigma \vdash ((\lambda x. x) y) : \sigma$}
         \end{prooftree}
         \end{frame}
         
\begin{frame}<0>
A more complex example.         
          \begin{prooftree}
            \AxiomC{$y : \tau, x : \tau \rightarrow \sigma \vdash x : \tau \rightarrow\sigma$ ({\bf Ax})}
            \AxiomC{$y : \tau, x : \tau \rightarrow \sigma \vdash y : \tau$ ({\bf Ax}) }
          \RightLabel{({\bf App})}
          \BinaryInfC{$y : \tau, x : \tau \rightarrow \sigma  \vdash (x y) : \sigma$}
          \RightLabel{({\bf Abs})}
          \UnaryInfC{$ y : \tau \vdash \lambda x. (x y) : (\tau \rightarrow \sigma) \rightarrow \sigma$}
          \RightLabel{({\bf Abs})}
          \UnaryInfC{$\vdash \lambda y.\lambda x. (x y) : \tau \rightarrow (\tau \rightarrow \sigma) \rightarrow \sigma$}
         \end{prooftree}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Back to CHI}
         We made one side of the Curry-Howard Correspondence more precise: the simply typed lambda calculus, which corresponds to some rudimenatry functional programming language. Now: what does it correspond to and how?

         In general programs (or computations) will correspond to certain kind of logics. Namely, {\bf intuitionistic logics}. These logics were created to formalize what is called constructive mathematics: that is, mathematics in which we are only interested in objects that can be effectively constructed.
\end{frame}
   
\begin{frame}{Implicational propositional logic}
     Consider the simplest intuitionistic logic {\bf Impl}. The formulae of {\bf Impl} are the following: 
     \begin{description}
     \item[Var] propositional variables 
     \item[Impl] $\phi \rightarrow \psi$, for $\phi, \psi$ propositional formulae
       \end{description}

     Examples of formulae: $p \rightarrow p$, $p \rightarrow (q \rightarrow p)$.

     Let $\Gamma$ be a set of formulae.  The theorems of {\bf Impl} are proved according to the following rules of inference:
       \[ \Gamma, \phi \vdash \phi \; ({\bf Ax}) \]

         \begin{prooftree}
           \AxiomC{$\Gamma, \phi \vdash \psi$}
                      \RightLabel{($\rightarrow$-I)}
           \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash \phi \rightarrow \psi$}
         \end{prooftree}

         \begin{prooftree}
           \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash \phi \rightarrow \psi$}
           \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash \phi$}
            \RightLabel{($\rightarrow$-E)}
           \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash \psi$}
         \end{prooftree}
\end{frame}

  

\begin{frame}{Curry-Howard Isomorphism}
       You may notice a parallelism between the rules of inference of {\bf Impl} and typing rules of simply typed lambda-calculus, this is the core of Curry-Howard Isomorphism.

\begin{frame}{Curry-Howard Isomorphism}

  Consider {\bf ST} with type variables being propositional variables; then types are formulae of {\bf Impl}. We can show that:
\begin{theorem}[CHI]
  A simple lambda term $M$ has a type $\tau$ in {\bf ST} if and only if $\tau$ is provable in {\bf Impl}.
  \end{theorem}
\end{frame}


      

      

    

\begin{frame}{Curry-Howard Isomorphism}
             You've seen the simplest type theory and propositional logic and how Curry-Howard Isomorphism works.
    
             Now we can expand {\bf ST} to include more terms and types (you can allow sum and product types, polymorphism, recursors - which allows you to formulate more functions) or alternatively expand the logic to be more expressible and complex (add other
             connectives, quantifiers, inductive definitions etc).
    
             But the principle stays the same and you have Curry-Howard Isomorphism for very complex type systems, such as Calculus of Inductive Constructions, on which Coq is based.

\begin{frame}<0>[fragile]{Proofs as functional programs}

  Let's return to one of our first proofs:

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
    Theorem plus_O_n : (forall n, O + n = n).
    Proof.
      intros n.
      simpl.
      reflexivity.
    Qed.

  \end{lstlisting}

  By Curry-Howard Isomorphism, the proof of this statement corresponds to constructing a term, that is, to writing a functional program.

   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
    plus_O_n = fun n : nat => eq_refl
     : forall n : nat, O + n = n
  \end{lstlisting}

 with \texttt{eq\_refl} being a term of type \texttt{x = x}.
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Proofs as functional programs}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
    Theorem plus_n_O : (forall n, n + O = n).
    Proof.
      induction n; simpl.
      - reflexivity.
      - rewrite IHn. 
      reflexivity.
    Qed.
  \end{lstlisting}
By Curry-Howard Isomorphism, the proof of this statement corresponds to constructing a term, that is, to writing a functional program.
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
    plus_n_O = fun n : nat =>
               nat_ind (fun n0 : nat => n0 + O = n0) eq_refl
               (fun (n0 : nat) (IHn : n0 + O = n0) =>
                eq_ind_r (fun n1 : nat => S n1 = S n0) eq_refl IHn) n
    : forall n : nat, n + O = n
  \end{lstlisting}
  where \texttt{nat\_ind} is a term with type that corresponds to induction on natural numbers and \texttt{eq\_refl} being a term of type \texttt{x = x}.

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Coq's kernel}
  Since the logic we are dealing with is more complex than {\bf Impl}, the functional programs corresponding to these types are also way more complex. However, checking whether a given term $t$ has a given type $\sigma$ is a decidable problem even for Calculus of Inductive Constructions. By Curry-Howard Isomorphism, this also yields a procedure for checking the correctness of proofs written in Coq's logic.  This algorithm constitutes Coq's trusted {\bf kernel}.

\section{Verifying C code: a detailed example}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Factorial example}
  Mathematical specification of factorial is a recursive equation, for ($0 \leq n$):\begin{align*}
  fact(0) &= 1 \\
  fact(n + 1) &= fact(n)*(n+1)    
  \end{align*}
  We can write it in Coq as a fixpoint definition:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
  Fixpoint fact (n : nat) : nat :=
    match n with
    | O => 1
    | S n' => n * fact n'
    end.
  \end{lstlisting}
  Note that this definition is also a functional program\footnote{This corresponds to the idea of verifying a program wrt reference implementation. For more complex program we will want to write a specification in a more declarative fashion.}.
 
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]{Factorial example: verifying a functional program}

  We can write a more efficient (tail-recursive) functional program to compute factorial

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
  Fixpoint fact_acc (n : nat) (acc : nat) :=
    match n with
    | 0 => acc
    | S k => fact_acc k (n * acc)
    end.

  Definition fact' (n : nat) :=
    fact_acc n 1.

  \end{lstlisting}

  Now we want to show that it actually computes factorial. To do this we can show in Coq that:
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
  Theorem fact'_correct : forall n, fact' n = fact n.
  \end{lstlisting}

   
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Factorial example: verifying a functional program}
  Now using Coq's extraction mechanism we can automatically extract an OCaml or Haskell function that is provably correct.

  Alternatively, one could easily embed a functional language into Coq and reason about the existing implementation in a similar fashion.

  But what if you want to verify code written in imperative language? Things get \emph{slightly} more complicated.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Factorial example: verifying a C program}

    To be able to state theorems about C programs in Coq we need to somehow represent C functions in Coq. This means  to model C syntax (as abstract syntax trees) and semantics (execution of programs) in Coq\footnote{For formalization of C semantics see \cite{Blazy09mechanizedsemantics}}.

    Luckily, this has already been done in the project called CompCert.
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{CompCert}
    CompCert is a verified compiler for C, almost entirely written in Coq and proved to work according to its specification (\url{http://compcert.inria.fr/}).

    \begin{quote}
      The striking thing about our CompCert results is that the middle-end bugs we found in all other compilers are absent. As of early 2011,the under-development version of CompCert is the only compiler we have tested for which Csmith cannot find wrong-code errors.
    \end{quote} ({\it Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers}, Yang et al., 2011)

\end{frame}
    
\begin{frame}{Verifying imperative programs}
    We use CompCert and use the following approach to verifying C programs:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Parse C code into a Coq abstract syntax tree using Clight\footnote{Clight is a subset of C} generator of CompCert
  \item Write a functional specification in Coq, using CompCert's memory model and integer representations
  \item Prove properties about the generated AST  using semantics of C (light) defined in CompCert
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Factorial example: verifying a C program}

 Factorial C implementation that we want to verify

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
unsigned int factorial (unsigned int input) {
  unsigned int output = 1;
  while (input) {
      output = output*input ;
      input = input - 1 ;
    } 
  return output ;
}

\end{lstlisting}

The specification stays the same.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{ Syntax of C programs in Coq}
Our C function can be represented in Coq as an abstract syntax tree:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
(Ssequence
  (* int output = 1 *)
  (Sset _output (Econst_int (Int.repr 1) tuint)) 
  (Ssequence 
    (* while (input) *)
    (Swhile (Etempvar _input tuint) 
      (Ssequence  
      (* output = output*input *)
        (Sset _output
          (Ebinop Omul (Etempvar _output tuint) 
          (Etempvar _input tuint) tuint)) 
          (* input = input - 1 *)
         (Sset _input (Ebinop Osub (Etempvar _input tuint) 
                     (Econst_int (Int.repr 1) tuint) tuint))))
            (* return output *)
            (Sreturn (Some (Etempvar _output tuint))))).
          
     \end{lstlisting}
     
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Clight Expressions: Examples}
  
  Expressions are annotated with types: 
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
    (* constant 0 of type int *)
    (* 0 *)
    (Econst_int (Int.repr 0) tint) 
     
    (* binary operration add applied to constants 0 and 1 *)
    (* 0 + 1 *)
    (Ebinop Oadd (Econst_int (Int.repr 0) tint)
    (Econst_int (Int.repr 1) tint) (tint))
    
    (* temporary variable of integer pointer type *)
    (* int *p *)
    (Etempvar _p (tptr tint)) 
    
    (* dereferencing integer pointer *)
    (* (*p) *)
    (Ederef (Etempvar _p (tptr tint)) tint)


  \end{lstlisting}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Clight Statements: Examples}

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]

      (Sset _s (Econst_int (Int.repr 1) tint))

      (* return s *)
      (Sreturn (Some (Etempvar _s tint)))
      
      (* int s = 1 ;
         int t = 0 ; *)
      (Ssequence 
        (Sset _s (Econst_int (Int.repr 1) tint))
        (Sset _t (Econst_int (Int.repr 0) tint)))
       
      (* while (s) { s = s - 1 } *)
      (Swhile (Etempvar _s tint) 
      (Sset _s (Ebinop Osub (Etempvar _input tint)
                (Econst_int (Int.repr 1) tint) tint))))


  \end{lstlisting}
  


\end{frame}

\subsection{Semantics of C programs in Coq}

\begin{frame}{Operational Semantics}
    Our goal is to prove that programs written in Clight behave as intended. To do this we need to formalize the notion of meaning of a C program. We do this using {\bf operational semantics}.

    \bigskip
    
    An operational semantics is a mathematical model of programming language execution. It is basically an interpreter defined formally.
    \bigskip
    
    We use big-step operational semantics used for all intermediate languages of CompCert.
  \end{frame}
  
  \begin{frame}[fragile]{Operational Semantics}
    The idea is to assign primitive values to constants and then compositionally compute values of expressions and results of execution of statements. 
    
    The evaluation of expressions and execution of statements is done in the context of global and local environments and memory state.
   \begin{itemize}
   %\item Each syntactic element is related to the intended result of executing this element (new local environment, memory, outcome or value).
    
    \item Expressions are mapped to memory locations or values (integers, bool etc).
    \item The execution of statements produces {\bf outcomes} (break, normal, return), an updated memory and local environment. 
   \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples}
     Expression  \texttt{(Econst\_int Int.zero tint)}   is evaluated to value \texttt{0} in any local environment and memory. 
      \[ le, m , \texttt{(Econst\_int Int.zero tint)} \Rightarrow 0, le, m \]

   Evaluation of statement \texttt{(Sset \_s (Econst\_int Int.zero tint))} in local environment $le$ and memory $m$ produces new local environment $le'$ with \texttt{\_s} mapped to value $0$ and a {\bf normal} outcome. 
   \[ 
   \begin{split}
le, m, \texttt{(Sset \_s (Econst\_int Int.zero tint))} \Rightarrow \\ le\{\_s = 0\}, m, \texttt{normal} 
\end{split}
\]

   Statement \texttt{(Sreturn (Some (Etempvar \_s tint)))} evaluates to a {\bf return}(\texttt{s}) outcome and leaves $le$ and memory unchanged.
     \[ le, m,\texttt{(Sreturn (Some (Etempvar \_s tint)))}  \Rightarrow le, m, \texttt{return}(\texttt{s}) \]
    

\end{frame}
   
\begin{frame}{C memory model}
   In order to verify a program written in C, one has to have a good model of variable environments, integer and pointer arithmetic and memory model. 
   
    A {\bf memory model} is a specification of memory states and operations over memory.
    
    In CompCert, memory states are accessed by addresses, pairs of a block
  identifier $b$ and a byte offset $ofs$ within that block.
  Each address is associated to permissions ranging from allowing all operations (read, write etc.) to allowing no operation.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{C memory model}
  The type \texttt{mem} of memory states has  the following 4 basic operations over memory states:
  \bigskip
\begin{description}
\item [load]: read memory at a given address;
\item [store]: store memory at a given address;
\item [alloc]: allocate a fresh memory block;
\item [free]: invalidate a memory block.
\end{description}
These operations are to satisfy some basic properties like:  \texttt{load} succeeds if and only if the access is valid for reading; the value returned by \texttt{load} belongs to the type of the memory quantity accessed etc. 

\end{frame}

 \begin{frame}{Correctness statement}
    Now we can state the correctness theorem for factorial:
    
    
   \begin{quote}
     For any memory $m$ and local environments $le$ with variables $\texttt{input}$ assigned $n$ in $le$, execution of $\texttt{f\_factorial}$ terminates and returns $fact(n)$ with resulting memory $m' = m$.
   \end{quote}
   
   \begin{theorem} $\forall le \; m,$ 
    
    $le\{\texttt{input = n}\} \rightarrow $
    
    $\exists le', le, m, \texttt{factorial} \Rightarrow  le', m,  {\bf return}(\texttt{fact n}) $
    
    \end{theorem}

   Hence we proved that factorial works correctly on all inputs\footnote{For simplicity, here we also assume that (fact n) doesn't overflow}.
      
      \end{frame}
    

    
    \begin{frame}<0>
      To see the proof and more examples go to factorial tutorial: \url{~/asn1verification/doc/tutorial/MiscExamples/factorial}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}{Conclusion}

      Coq can be used to prove correctness of imperative programs, as well as functional ones. However, the former requires an additional step of embedding C syntax and semantics in Coq. 
      
      Going back to our first example of \texttt{asn\_strtoimax\_lim}:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item  We wrote a formal specification of the function (based on the comment and analysis of the function)
          \item Then we produced Clight AST of the function using Clight generator of CompCert
          \item And proved that the resulting AST evaluates to correct values on all valid inputs using operational semantics. 
            \end{itemize}
            
            Moreover, using CompCert's C memory model we can state properties about correct memory usage and heap and stack bounds.
